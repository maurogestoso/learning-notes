# RDS - Relational Database Services

Relational DBs in AWS:
  - MS SQL Server
  - Oracle
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Amazon Aurora
  - MariaDB

- Runs on VMs, but you can't SSH into them
- Not serverless
- Aurora Serverless is Serverless

## Multi AZ
- For disaster recovery
- You have a primary and secondary DB
- Replication is automatic
- If your primary goes down, AWS detects it and automatically update the DNS to point to the secondary
- Automatic failover

## Read replicas
- For performance
- Read only copies of your DB
- Every time you do a write, it is replicated to a replica DB
- No automatic failover
- If your primary DB gets too busy, you can point half of your EC2 instances to the read replica to alleviate load
- Up to 5 copies
- You can have RR of RR but watch out for replication latency
- You can promote RR to independent DBs
- You can enable multi AZ for RRs
- You need backups turned ON
- Available for:
  - MS SQL Server
  - Oracle
  - PostgreSQL
  - Amazon Aurora
  - MariaDB

## Automated Backups

- Allow you to recover your DB to any point in time within a retention period (1-35 days)
- Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and also store transaction logs
- When you do a recovery, AWS will apply the latest snapshot and then apply the stored transactions
- This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second
- Enabled by default
- Backup data is stored in S3 (you get free storage space equal to your DB storage)
- Backups are taken in a defined window, you may experience latency during backups
- When you restore an automatic backup or a manual snapshot, the result is a new instances with a new DNS endpoint
- Encryption at rest using KMS is supported for all 6 DBs (data, backups, read replicas and snapshots are encrypted)
-
