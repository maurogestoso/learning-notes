# Redshift

- Fast and powerful, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service
- Starts at $.25 per hour with no commitment or upfront costs and scale to a PB or more for $1000 per TB per year

## OLTP vs OLAP

- On Line Transaction Processing
  - Example: order number 123 pulls a row of data such as: Name, Date, Address, Status
- On Line Analytics Processing
  - Example: Net profit for the North West for the digital radio product -> pulls in large number of records (sum of radios sold in MCR, sum of radios sold in Lpool, unit cost of radios, sales prices, etc.)

## Config
- Single node 160GB
- Multi node
  - Leader node (manages client connections and receives queries)
  - Compute node (store data and perform queries and computations) up to 128 CNs

## Advanced compression
- Compression happens at column level (you can compress better when data is of the same type)
- Doesn't require indexes or materialised views (uses less space than traditional DBs)
- When loading data into an empty table, it automatically samples your data and selects the most appropriate compression scheme

## Massively Parallel Processing
- Automatically distributes data and query load across all nodes
- Easy to add nodes/scale up

## Backups
- Enabled by default, 1 day retention period
- Max retention: 35 days
- Attempts to maintain at least 3 copies of your data (original and replica on the compute nodes and a backup in S3)
- Asynchronously replicate snapshots to S3 in a different AZ for disaster recovery

## Pricing
- Compute node hours (1 unit per node per hour)
- Backup
- Data transfer (only within a VPC)

## Security
- Encrypted in transit using SSL
- Encrypted at rest using AES-256
- By default Redshift manages key but you can also use KMS or Hardware Security Module


## Availability
- 1 AZ
- Can restore snapshots to a new AZ
