# Storage Gateway

A service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration.

It's a virtual appliance that you install in a hypervisor (VM image) in an on-premises machine. The gateway will asynchronously replicate your on-premises data to the cloud.

Types:
- File Gateway (NFS)
  - Files are stored as objects in S3 buckets throug a Network File System (NFS) mount point
  - Ownership, permissions and timestamps are stored in S3 metadata
  - Once transferred to S3, objects can be managed as native S3 objects
  - All features apply: versioning, lifecycle, cross-region replication 
- Volumes Gateway (virtual hard disks)
  - Presents your applications with disk volumes using the iSCSI block protocol
  - Data written to these volumes can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots of your volumes and stored as EBS snapshots
  - Snapshots are incremental backups that only capture changed blocks (compressed by default)
  - Stored volumes
    - Store an entire copy of your dataset locally and then async backup that data to AWS
    - Low-latency access to data
    - Create storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices
    - Data is backed up as EBS snapshots to S3 (1GB-16TB)
  - Cached volumes
    - Use S3 as your primary data storage
    - Retain frequently accessed data locally
    - Minimize to scale on-premises storage infrastructure
    - Volumes up to 32TiB and attach them to iSCSI devices
- Tape Gateway (VTL) backup and archiving solution, creates virtual tapes to S3 and Glacier
