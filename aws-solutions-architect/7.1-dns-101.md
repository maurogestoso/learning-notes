# DNS 101

- Like a phonebook for the internet
- Used to convert human friendly domain names into IP addresses
- IPv4 is a 32bit field ~4 billion addresses
- IPv6 is a 128bit field ~340 undecillion addresses
- `.com` is a top level domain name
- In `.co.uk`, `.uk` is the top level domain and `.co` is the second level domain
- Top level domains are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top level domains.
- Domains are registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain names across the internet.
- Each domain is registered in a central database, WhoIS

- Every DNS address begins with a Start of Authority (SOA) Record
  - The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
  - The administrator of the zone
  - The current version of the data file
  - The default TTL file on resource records

- Name Server (NS) Record
  - Used by Top Level Domain servers to direct traffic to the Content DNS server which contains the authoritative DNS records

Example:
- You request hellocloudgurus.com
- Browser looks up the TLD and gets something like: `hellocludgurus.com. 172800 IN NS ns.awsdns.com`, that's the address to the Name Server
- Query the NS Record and it gives us the SOA, which will have all DNS records

- Address (A) Record
  - The fundamental type of DNS record.
  - Used by a computer to translate the name of the domain to an IP address

- Canonical Name (CName) Record
  - Can be used to resolve one domain name to another
  - For example, you may have a mobile website with the domain name `m.acloud.guru` that is used for when users browse to your domain name on their mobile devices. You may also want the name `mobile.acloud.guru` to resolve to this same address.

- Alias Records
  - Used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions or S3 buckets that are configured as websites
  - Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name to another `target` DNS name
  - Key difference: a CNAME can't be used for naked domain names (zone apex record). You can't have a CNAME for `http://acloud.guru`, it must be either an A record or an Alias.

- ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, you resolve to them using a DNS name
- Common DNS types:
  - SOA
  - NS
  - A
  - CNAME
  - Alias
  - MX (mail)
  - PTR (reverse of Alias)

## Routing Policies
- Simple
  - You can only have one record with multipe IP addresses.
  - If you specify multiple values in a record, R53 returns all values to the user in a random order
- Weighted
  - Allows you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned
  - For example you can set 10% of your traffic to go to US-EAST-1 and 90% to EU-WEST-1
- Latency-based
  - Allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (i.e. which region will give them the fastest response time)
  - You create a latency resource record set for the EC2 or ELB resource in each region that hosts your website
  - When R53 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency
- Failover
  - Used when you want to create an active/passive set up.
  - You may want your primary site to be in eu-west-2 and your secondary DR site in ap-southeast-2
  - R53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check
- Geolocation
  - Choose where your traffic will be sent based on your users location
- Geoproximity
  - Allows you to route traffic to your resources based on the location of users and resources
  - Only available under traffic flow (flow diagrams for DNS setup)
- Multivalue answer
  - Returns multiple values, check health and only return healthy values
  - Simple routing with healthchecks

- TTL
  - The amount of seconds that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the user's own local PC
  - The lower the TTL, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet
