# CloudFront

A CDN is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on their geo-location, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

AWS CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including static, dynamic, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. It's designed to integrate with other AWS services but also non-AWS servers.

- Edge Location: the location where content will be cached. Separate to a region/AZ (over 50 ELs in the world)
  - ELs are not read only, you can put objects onto them
  - Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (time to live)
  - Invalidations: you can clear cached objects but you will be charged
- Origin: the origin of all the files a CDN distributes (S3, EC2 instance, ELB, Route53)
- Distribution: the name given to a collection of edge locations, which form a CDN
  - Web Distribution: typically used for websites
  - RMTP Distribution: used for media streaming

- You can have multiple origins from different services
- You can enable Geo-Restrictions (white/black-list countries)
