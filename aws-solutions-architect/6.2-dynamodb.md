# DynamoDB

- NoSQL database
- For apps that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
- Fully managed
- Supports both document and key-value pairs
- Stored on SSD storage, spread across 3 different data centers
- Eventual consistent reads (default)
  - Consistency across all copies is usually reached within a second
  - Repeating a read after a short time should return the updated data (best read performance)
- Strongly consistent reads
  - returns a result that reflects all writes received
