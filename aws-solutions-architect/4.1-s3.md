# Chapter 4 - Object Storage and CDN

Services: 
- S3
- Glacied
- CloudFront

## S3 101

- Simple Storage Service
- A safe place to store files
- Object-based storage: upload images, videos, files
- As opposed to block-based storage (for OSs and DBs)

- 0B to 5TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets
- S3 is a universal namespace (buckets have a DNS address), so names have to be unique globally
- Successful uploads return a HTTP 200

- Data consistency model:
  - Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (takes some time to propagate)

- S3 is a simple key-value store
  - Key: the name of the object
  - Value: the date
  - Version ID
  - Metadata
  - Subresources: access control lists
  - Torrent

- Built for 99.99% availability, AWS guarantee 99.9% SLA
- 11x9s durability
- Tiered storage
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure data using access contro lists and bucket policies

### Storage Tiers/Classes

- S3 Standard:
  - 99.99% availability, 11x9s durability
  - Stored redundantly across multiples devices and facilities
  - No retrieval fees
  - Designed to sustain loos of 2 facilities concurrently
- S3 - IA: 
  - For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
  - Lower fee than standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee
- S3 One Zone IA:
  - lower cost option without multiple Availability Zone data resilience
- Glacier:
  - cheapest but for archival only
  - Expedited, standard or bulk. A standard retrieval time takes 3-5 hours.

### Charges
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing (metadata)
- Data Transfer Pricing (across regions)
- Transfer acceleration: leverage CloudFront and AWS internal networks to arrive faster to edges



### Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (all writes and deletes)
- Great backup tool
- Cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with lifecycle rules
- You can enable MFA deletes for an additional security layer

### Cross Region Replication

- You can add replication rules to a bucket
- Replicate entire bucket or just items with a prefix
- Existing objects don't get replicated, only new ones after creating the replication rules
- Deletes are not replicated
- You can change the storage tier of the replication bucket

### Lifecycle Management

- Use case: you generate a lot of data that is only relevant for 30 days. After that you might want to transition to IA or Glaciar, or even delete files
- You define rules for all files or a subset, transitions to different tiers and expiration
- Can be used with versioning

## Security and Encryption

- By default, all new buckets are private
- Setup access control:
  - Bucket Policies (bucket wide)
  - Access Control Lists (all the way down to individual objects)
- Configure to create access logs of all requests (dump logs to another bucket)

- Encryption:
  - In transit: when sending data from bucket to client
    - HTTPS, SSL/TLS
  - At rest:
    - Server side
      - S3 managed keys (each object encrypted with its own key)
      - KMS managed keys (benefit: audit trail of key usage, manage your own keys)
      - Customer provided keys
    - Client side: data is encrypted client side

### Transfer Acceleration
- You can get a URL at a local Edge location to upload your files to
- AWS uses their internal network to take data from the EL to the S3 bucket

### Static Website Hosting
- You can enable redirecting on each object's metadata
